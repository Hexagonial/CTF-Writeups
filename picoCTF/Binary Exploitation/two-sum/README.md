## Procedure
The given math problem is impossible in everyday math, but in the context of computers we can just think about overflow. A 32-bit signed integer can only hold a maximum positive value of 2147483647 before adding 1 more to it causes it to overflow to -2147483648, a negative number. Therefore, two positive numbers `n1` and `n2` that fulfill `n1 > n1+n2` can be `n1=2147483647` and `n2=1`.

n1 > n1 + n2 OR n2 > n1 + n2 
What two positive numbers can make this possible: 
2147483647
1
You entered 2147483647 and 1
You have an integer overflow
YOUR FLAG IS: hammy{u win - hammy}
```

## Solution
1. Enter `2147483647` on one line, and `1` on the next.
