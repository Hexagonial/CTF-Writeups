<summary>Hint 1</summary>

> This is an introduction of format string vulnerabilities. Look up "format specifiers" if you have never seen them before.

## Procedure
Running the program starts a little game where you have to select the correct menu options to get the flag, and you must choose from the printed menu options.

Selecting the options with format string specifiers in them gets you the flag, since the second correct option triggers the segfault handler that prints the flag.

```
$ ./format-string-0
