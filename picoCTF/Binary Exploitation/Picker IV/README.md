## Hints
Here are the hints provided by the challenge author.

<summary>Hint 1</summary>

> With Python, there are no binaries. With compiled languages like C, there is source code, and there are binaries. Binaries are created from source code, they are a conversion from the human-readable source code, to the highly efficient machine language, in this case: x86_64.

> How can you find the address that win is at?
</details>

## Procedure
The program asks us what address we want to jump to.
```
$ ./picker-IV
Enter the address in hex to jump to, excluding '0x': hammy
You input 0x0
Segfault triggered! Exiting.
```

According to gdb (as well as the source), there is a `win()` function which we would probably want to jump to.
```
gef➤  info func
All defined functions:

Non-debugging symbols:
0x0000000000401000  _init
...
0x0000000000401276  print_segf_message
0x000000000040129e  win
0x0000000000401334  main
```
As it doesn't look like the binary was compiled with PIE, we can probably try entering `40129e` as our desired jump destination.
```
$ ./picker-IV	
Enter the address in hex to jump to, excluding '0x': 40129e
You input 0x40129e
You won!
hammy{u win - hammy}
```

## Solution
1. Find the address of the `win` function in gdb
2. Set that address as your input to the program to win.
